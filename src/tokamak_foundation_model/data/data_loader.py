class WelfordTensor:
    """
    Online Welford algorithm for per-channel statistics on batched tensors.

    Accumulates running mean, variance, minimum, and maximum over an arbitrary
    number of :meth:`update` calls without storing the full dataset in memory.
    Statistics are computed along the channel axis (axis 1 for 3-D and 4-D
    tensors) by aggregating across the batch dimension and all remaining
    non-channel dimensions.  Batches that contain any ``NaN`` value are
    silently skipped.

    The shape of the statistics vectors depends on the input rank:

    =========  ===================================  ===========
    ``ndim``   Interpretation                       Stats shape
    =========  ===================================  ===========
    4          ``(B, C, F, T)`` — spectrograms /    ``(C,)``
               time series
    3          ``(B, S, T)`` — profiles             ``(S,)``
    ≤ 2        ``(B, T)`` or scalar — video /       ``(1,)``
               fallback
    =========  ===================================  ===========

    Attributes
    ----------
    mean : torch.Tensor or None
        Running per-channel mean, shape ``(C,)``.  ``None`` before the first
        :meth:`update` call.
    std : torch.Tensor or None
        Per-channel sample standard deviation, shape ``(C,)``.  Populated
        only after :meth:`compute` is called.
    min_val : torch.Tensor or None
        Running per-channel minimum, shape ``(C,)``.  ``None`` before the
        first :meth:`update` call.
    max_val : torch.Tensor or None
        Running per-channel maximum, shape ``(C,)``.  ``None`` before the
        first :meth:`update` call.
    n : int
        Total number of scalar samples seen so far (summed over all
        non-channel dimensions across all batches).
    M2 : torch.Tensor or None
        Running sum of squared deviations from the mean (Welford
        accumulator), shape ``(C,)``.  ``None`` before the first
        :meth:`update` call.
    initialized : bool
        ``True`` once the internal buffers have been allocated on the first
        :meth:`update` call.

    Notes
    -----
    The parallel (batch) variant of Welford's algorithm is used to combine
    each incoming batch with the accumulated state in a single pass
    [1]_.  All accumulation is done in ``float64`` regardless of the input
    dtype to minimise floating-point cancellation errors.

class TokamakH5Dataset(Dataset):
    """
    PyTorch Dataset for multi-modal tokamak plasma diagnostics stored in HDF5.

    Each item corresponds to a fixed-duration time window (chunk) drawn from a
    single shot file.  The processing pipeline for every chunk is:

    1. Load raw signal / movie data at the native sampling rate from HDF5.
    2. Optionally compute an STFT magnitude spectrogram (signals only).
    3. Resample to the modality's target frequency via linear or trilinear
       interpolation.
    4. Apply the configured preprocessing transformation
       (see :class:`PreprocessConfig`).

    Two operating modes are supported:

    **Standard mode** (``prediction_mode=False``)
        Returns a flat dictionary ``{modality_name: tensor}`` covering the
        half-open interval ``[t_start, t_start + chunk_duration_s)``.

    **Prediction mode** (``prediction_mode=True``)
        Loads an extended window of
        ``chunk_duration_s + prediction_horizon_s`` seconds, processes it
        jointly, then splits into
        ``{"inputs": {…}, "targets": {…}}``.

    Parameters
    ----------
    hdf5_path : str
        Path to a preprocessed HDF5 shot file (output of the
        data-preparation pipeline).
    chunk_duration_s : float, optional
        Duration of each time window in seconds.  Default is ``0.5``.
    max_duration_s : float, optional
        Maximum duration of a shot to be considered.
    n_fft : int, optional
        FFT size used for STFT computation.  Determines the number of
        frequency bins: ``n_fft // 2 + 1``.  Default is ``1024``.
    hop_length : int, optional
        STFT hop size in samples.  Default is ``256``.
    preprocessing_stats : dict or None, optional
        Nested statistics dictionary as returned by
        :func:`compute_preprocessing_stats`.  When provided, the per-modality
        statistics are injected into the corresponding
        :class:`PreprocessConfig` instances.  Default is ``None``
        (no statistics applied).
    prediction_mode : bool, optional
        If ``True``, operate in prediction mode.  Default is ``False``.
    prediction_horizon_s : float, optional
        Duration of the prediction target window in seconds.  Only used
        when ``prediction_mode=True``.  Default is ``0.2``.
    input_signals : list of str or None, optional
        Modality names to include in the returned batch (or in the
        ``'inputs'`` dict in prediction mode).  Defaults to
        ``['ece', 'co2', 'mhr']``.
    target_signals : list of str or None, optional
        Modality names to include in the ``'targets'`` dict in prediction
        mode.  Defaults to ``['d_alpha', 'mse', 'ts_core_density']``.

    Attributes
    ----------
    signal_configs : list of SignalConfig
        Per-instance deep copy of :attr:`SIGNAL_CONFIGS`, updated with
        any statistics from *preprocessing_stats*.
    movie_configs : list of MovieConfig
        Per-instance deep copy of :attr:`MOVIE_CONFIGS`.
    hdf5_path : Path
        Resolved path to the HDF5 file.
    duration : float
        Total shot duration from t = 0 in seconds, as inferred from the
        HDF5 time axes.
    length : int
        Number of non-overlapping chunks available (i.e. ``__len__``).
    n_freq_bins : int
        Number of STFT frequency bins: ``n_fft // 2 + 1``.
    stft_window : torch.Tensor
        Hann window tensor of length ``n_fft`` used for STFT computation.
